     * constructor vs setter
     *
     * constructor: good when you want to create object with initial state (attribute values given)
     *
     * setter: good when you want to change the value of existing object fields
     *
     * How to generate a class that generate only immutable objects:
     * create a class with private instance filed add a constructor to set the value while object is being created
     * only provide getters for private fields
     * but do not provide setters for private fields
     *
     *
     * any data type that not primitive type it is called reference type
     *
     * by its type:
     *  primitive | reference variable
     *
     *  by its location:
     *  local variable
     *  method parameter
     *  field
